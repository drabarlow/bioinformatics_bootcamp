## Unix-like systems and bash

### 1. Logging on to SCW

```bash
# Note Windows users will generally use an ssh client like putty
# Linux and Mac users just ssh from terminal:

ssh username@hawklogin.cf.ac.uk
```

### 2. Basic bash commands

Unix-like (linux and Mac) generally use a bash shell (or something like it).

"*Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script. Like most Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.*" 

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)

```bash
# print working directory
pwd

# print something to screen
echo "hello"

# redirect output to file 
echo "hello" > hello.txt
echo "hello2" >> hello.txt

# list contents of directory
ls

# help menu
ls --help

# view contents of file
cat
less
head

# count lines and characters
wc -l
wc -c

# search for content in files
grep --help
grep "2" hello.txt

# pipes
grep "2" hello.txt | wc -l

# deleting (CAREFUL!!!)
rm hello.txt

# let's make some more files
yes hello | head -n 100 > my_file1.txt
yes goodbye | head -n 100 > my_file2.txt

# wildcards
cat my_file* > my_combined_file.txt

# a note on file extensions
mv my_combined_file2.txt my_combined_file2.mp3
mv my_combined_file2.txt my_combined_file2

# deleting with wildcards (VERY CAREFUL!!!)
rm my*

# Download file from internet
wget https://dnazoo.s3.wasabisys.com/Alligator_mississippiensis/ASM28112v4_HiC.fasta.gz

# Note file is compressed with gzip compression
# view contents without unzipping
zcat ASM28112v4_HiC.fasta.gz | less

# unzip
gunzip ASM28112v4_HiC.fasta.gz

# log off
exit

```

### 3. Your turn :)

- Count number of scaffold names in the Alligator genome
- Print scaffold names to a file
- Print only scaffold names 10 to 20 to a file
- Count the number of bases in the first line of DNA sequence (i.e. line 2)
- Work out the genome size (don't worry about newline characters in your base counts for now)
- try to connect graphically to SCWales

### 4. Basic bash commands 2

```bash
# let's make a file of random numbers
# we can use the bash variable $RANDOM (more on variables later)
# write 10 random numbers to a file
echo $RANDOM >> my_randoms.txt

# sort the numbers
sort my_randoms.txt

# check for duplicates
sort my_randoms.txt | uniq -c

# stream editing: sed
# see https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html
# sed 's/search_string/replace_string/g' inputfile
# s = substitute
# g = global
sed --help
sed 's/1/Axel/g' my_randoms.txt

# something more complex
# . all characters
# \0 [replace with] the same character
sed 's/./\0 /g' my_randoms.txt 

```

### 5. Your turn

- Using the help menu and Google, work out how to get grep to report the line numbers of each scaffold header in the Alligator genome file
- Extract the sequence of the first scaffold and calculate the base composition (number A, T, G, C)

### 6. Bash scripts

- Bash scripts allow sets of commands to be executed in an automated fashion
- Files contain bash scripts are given the extension `.sh` by convention
- fist line is the bash **shebang**, it instructs the system to parse the file using `bash` (as opposed to `python, perl, R`, etc.)
- lines starting `#` are comments
- commands are executed from top to bottom

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# let's make some files
yes hello | head -n 100 > my_file1.txt
yes goodbye | head -n 100 > my_file2.txt

# combine files
cat my_file* > my_combined_file.txt

echo "job finished"

```

#### A note on text editors

- never (ever) use a word processor
- plain text editor (many available)
- includes terminal plain text editors
- be careful windows people :)
- example: `vim`

```bash
# open file
vim my_script.sh

# enter insert mode
i

# do stuff ######################################

# exit insert mode 
[ESC]

# write changes to file
:w

# quit
:q
```

#### Executing bash scripts

```bash
sh my_script.sh
```

### 7. Your turn :)

- Generate the `bash` script described above and execute
- try modifying the script, for example to delete the intermediary files my_file1.txt and my_file2.txt

### 8. Variables

- In `bash`, variables can be used to store data in memory
- Works exactly like objects in `R`
- After they are defined, variables can be recalled using `$`
- anything entered after the script call becomes variables `$1, $2, $3`, etc. 
- Or they can be defined in the script `variable=value`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# script makes lists of 2 words, which can be entered when the script is called
# $count controls the length of the list
# call the script like:
# sh my_script.sh hello goodbye

# declare variables
count=100

# main script 

# let's make some files
yes $1 | head -n $count > my_file1.txt
yes $2 | head -n $count > my_file2.txt

# combine files
cat my_file* > my_combined_file.txt

echo "job finished"
```

### 9. Loops

- Loops are quite an advanced feature, but extremely useful
- here we look at a basic while loop with a counter

```bash
#!/bin/bash 

x=0

while [ $x -lt 10 ]; do
  echo The counter is $x
  let x=x+1
done
```

### 10. Your turn :)

- Generate the script shown in part 8. variables
- execute your script, and try changing the variables. Is behaviour as expected?
- try modifying your script, for example entering the counts at the command line, or specifying the name of the output file at the command line
- Generate the script shown in part 9. loops. Execute
- Remember making the file of random numbers above, wasn't this annoying? Try to make this file and carry out the same operation by making a script incorporating a loop

## Supercomputing Wales and slurm

### 1. Filesystem

```bash

# print working directory
pwd

# list contents of working directory
ls

# make directory
mkdir my_directory

# change directory
cd my_directory

# make file
echo hello > hello.txt

# move up one level in heirarchy
cd ..

# list contents of new directory 
ls ./my_directory

# move to root directory 
cd /

# take a tour :)
```

### 2. Modules

```bash
# module searching
module avail
module avail R

# module load
module load R/4.2.0

# module unload
module purge
```

### 3. Slurm

```bash
# You are currently using the log in node. 
# Do not run resource-intensive jobs on the log in node!

# use slurm to open an active bash shell on a compute node
srun --nodes=1 --ntasks=4 --mem=4G --time=0-01:00 --pty /bin/bash

# the queue
squeue
squeue -u username

# do something resource intensive
module load pigz
pigz -p ASM28112v4_HiC.fasta

# exit
exit

# check efficiency
seff jobid
```

### 4. Slurm scripts

- Running a live terminal is not very convenient
- We need a way of submitting jobs to the queue: `slurm` job script
- It's just a bash script, with additional options passed to `slurm` using `#SBATCH` 

```bash
#!/bin/bash --login
###
#job name
#SBATCH --job-name=example
#job stdout file
#SBATCH --output=/path/to/dir/example%J
#job stderr file
#SBATCH --error=/path/to/dir/example_err%J
#maximum job time in D-HH:MM
#SBATCH --time=0-00:01
#number of nodes
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#number of parallel processes (tasks)
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#memory in Gb 
#SBATCH --mem=1G

echo hello > hello.txt
```

```bash
# submit to queue
sbatch job_script.sh
```

### 5. Your turn :)
